# LeftWM Community Themes

LeftWM is a window manager built around the idea of themes.
Here you can share your theme with the community for others to enjoy.
See what others created.

## Sharing your theme

Please consider sharing your theme for others to see. Just make a pull request and we will work with you to get your theme included.
If you need help creating a theme please refer to the themes guidelines and documentation [here.](https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm/tree/master/themes)
If you can't find what you are looking for please ask We want to help.

In addition to the standard guidelines for themes we ask that you also include a screenshot so others can see your hard work.
